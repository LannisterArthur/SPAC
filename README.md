# Proof of Persistent Aliveness for Cyber-Physical Systems

This is a C++ project utilizing the MIRACL cryptographic library for cryptographic operations. The project contains the 'SPAC' folder, which includes files that can be compiled and executed.


## Project Structure

- `SPAC`: Contains files related to Scalable Proof of Aliveness Chain.


## Dependencies

This project depends on the MIRACL cryptographic library. Make sure you have MIRACL installed on your system before attempting to compile and run the project. You can find the MIRACL library [here](https://github.com/miracl/MIRACL).


## Compilation and Execution

To compile and execute the files in each folder, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the desired folder (`SPAC`).
2. Run the following commands:

```bash
make
./popa
```
